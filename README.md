# hello-world
Here is my first repository which will probably contain a bunch of ideas and other mumbo jumbo junk. 

Hello, my name is Connia Ren. I am a young individual persuing an undergraduate degree in Biology and Mathematics at McGill University. However, I am at crossroads as I cannot decide whether I want to switch my current double major from Math to Computer Science & Biology. With the ever changing technological needs in todays field of science, the imminently essential skill of knowing how to maninpulate a computer seems promising in future innovations of biological & medical systems. 

This github account will likely document my experience surrounding this journey towards finding my major (and likely beyond that too). I have very limited, elementary experience in the following: HTML+ CSS, Javascript, Java, Python and Turing (relevant today?????). 

FunFacts: I thrive on Vihn's Pho, Mandy's Salads, and VitaSoy Lychee Juice. I also like breeding Drosophila Melanogaster in my spare time.
